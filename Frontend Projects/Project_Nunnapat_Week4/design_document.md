# Fashion Week Website - Design Document

## Part D: Layout Strategy & Goals

**Introduction:**
For my final project, I have designed a website dedicated to "Fashion Week," covering its history, global locations, and iconic brands. My goal is to create an elegant, informative, and visually appealing resource for fashion enthusiasts. The layout strategy focuses on a clean, minimalist aesthetic that mimics the sophistication of high-fashion magazines. I am targeting an audience who appreciates style, history, and luxury. Success will be measured by the website's responsiveness across devices (especially the mobile navigation), the clarity of information presentation, and the seamless user experience provided by smooth transitions and intuitive navigation.

**Goals:**

1.  **Visual Appeal:** Create a premium look using a refined color palette and high-quality imagery.
2.  **Responsiveness:** Ensure the site functions perfectly on mobile devices, particularly the hamburger menu.
3.  **Information Accessibility:** Present historical data and brand information in easy-to-read formats like grids and tables.

**Audience:**

- Fashion students and enthusiasts.
- People interested in the history of design and culture.
- Users looking for a quick overview of the "Big Four" fashion capitals.

**Metrics for Success:**

- **Mobile Compatibility:** The hamburger menu must toggle correctly on small screens.
- **Navigation:** Users can move between Home, History, Locations, and Brands without broken links.
- **Aesthetics:** The design consistently applies the chosen color palette and typography.

## Part B: Color Palette Selection

For this project, I selected a **Sophisticated Neutral** color palette to reflect the luxury and timelessness of the fashion industry.

**Selected Colors:**

1.  **Cream / Off-White (#f9f5f0):** Used as the primary background color. Unlike stark white, cream adds warmth and elegance, resembling the paper of a high-end fashion editorial.
2.  **Charcoal / Soft Black (#1a1a1a):** Used for text and primary headings. It provides high contrast for readability while being softer and more "fashionable" than pure black.
3.  **Muted Gold / Bronze (#c5a059):** Used as an accent color for hover states, underlines, and key buttons. This adds a touch of luxury and prestige, associating the site with high-value brands and runway glamour.

**Why this palette?**
This tri-color combination creates a sense of exclusivity and refinement. Bright, primary colors were avoided as they can feel too casual or distracting. The goal was to let the content (the fashion images) shine, while the interface remains understated and chic.
